1: These mist covered mountains
2: Are a home now for me
3: But my home is the lowlands
4: And always will be
5: Someday you'll return to
6: Your valleys and your farms
7: And you'll no longer burn to be
8: Brothers in arms
9: 
10: Through these fields of destruction
11: Baptisms of fire
12: I've witnessed your suffering
13: As the battle raged high
14: And though they did hurt me so bad
15: In the fear and alarm
16: You did not desert me
17: My brothers in arms
18: 
19: There's so many different worlds
20: So many different suns
21: And we have just one world
22: But we live in different ones
23: Now the sun's gone to hell and
24: The moon's riding high
25: Let me bid you farewell
26: Every man has to die
27: But it's written in the starlight
28: And every line in your palm
29: We're fools to make war
30: On our brothers in arms
