304 Not Modified - This response indicates that the resource has not been modified since the date specified in the "If-modified-since" header. As a result, the server doesn't send the resource again in the response body but rather informs the client that it can continue to use its cached copy of the resource. This response is a way to save bandwidth and reduce unnecessary data transfer when the client's cached copy is still valid.
